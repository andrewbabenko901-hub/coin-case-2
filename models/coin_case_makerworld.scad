// ===========================================================================
// Customisable coin case — a hinged, print-in-place box for a single coin.
//
// One file builds both halves. They share one parameter block, so the pocket
// diameter, the outside dimensions and the wall thickness are worked out once
// and used by both halves — the two sides can never drift apart.
//
// Set the coin diameter and thickness and everything else follows: the cavity
// is sized from the coin, and the body grows automatically whenever the coin
// would leave less than `min_wall` of material around it. Up to 8 lines of
// text and an icon are engraved on the outside of the lid. Hold the case with
// the hinge at the bottom and the rounded corners up — that is the way the
// engraving reads.
//
// Pure OpenSCAD CSG geometry (cube / cylinder / hull / rotate_extrude /
// linear_extrude / difference) — no imported meshes.
//
// Printing: pick render_part = "print". Both halves lie flat with the hinge
// already engaged, so the case comes off the plate assembled. Pockets face
// up and need no supports; the engraved face sits on the build plate.
//
// Axes: X — length, Y — thickness (the pocket faces +Y), Z — height.
